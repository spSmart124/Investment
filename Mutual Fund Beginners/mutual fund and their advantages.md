### Limitation of Mutual Fund
1. Lack of portfolio customization
1. Choice overload
1. No control over costs

#### Lack of portfolio customization
Some brokers offer Portfolio Management Schemes (PMS) to large investors. In a PMS, the investor has better control over what securities are bought and sold on his behalf.

On the other hand, a unit-holder in a mutual fund is just one of several thousand investors in a scheme. Once a unit-holder has bought into the scheme, investment management is left to the fund manager (within the broad parameters of the investment objective). Thus, the unit-holder does not have control over what securities or investments the scheme would invest into.

#### Choice overload
There are multiple mutual fund schemes offered by 42 mutual fund. Also, there are multiple options within those schemes which makes it difficult for investors to choose between them.

In order to deal with this choice overload, SEBI has introduced the categorisation of mutual funds to ensure uniformity in characteristics of similar types of schemes launched by different mutual funds.

#### No control over costs
All investors' money is pooled together in a scheme. Costs incurred for managing the scheme are shared by all unit-holders in proportion to their holding of Units in the scheme. Thereforce, an individual investor has no control over the costs in a scheme.

SEBI has however imposed certain limits on the expenses that can be charged to any scheme.
