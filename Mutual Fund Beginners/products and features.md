## Types of Funds
Based on entry and exit criteria of investors, funds are of two types.
* Open-Ended Fund
* Close-Ended Fund

### Open-Ended Fund
* Allows investors to enter and exit at his convenience
* Allows investors to buy the units even after the NFO period is over
* The buy/sell of units takes place at the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by fund

**Note:**
* A new fund is launched by AMC, is known as New Fund Offer (NFO)
* Units are offered to investors at the par value of Rs. 10/unit
* When the fund sells units, the investors buy the units from the fund and when the investor wishes to redeem units, the fund repurchases the units from the investor. This can be done even after the NFO has closed

### Close-Ended Fund
* Restricts the freedom of entry and exit
* Allows investors to invest only during NFO period; that is as long as the scheme is open for subscription
* Does not allow new investors to enter or existing investors to exit once the NFO closes and till the term of the scheme comes to an end
* Lists its schemes on stock exchanges in order to provide entry and exit options to investors
* Provides opportunity for investors to buy and sell the units from each other
* Is just like buying/selling shares on the stock exchange and is done through a stock broker

**Note:**
The outstanding units of the fund does not increase/decrease since the fund itself is not selling any units.

Sometimes, close ended funds also offer 'buy-back of fund shares/units', thus offering another avenue for investors to exit the fund.

Therefore, regulations drafted in India permit investors in close ended funds to exit even before the term is over.


Based on type of involvement of fund manager, funds are of two types.
* Actively Managed Funds
* Passive Funds

### Actively Managed Funds
* These are funds wherein the fund manager is:
    * Actively involved and has a greater role to play
    * Free to choose the investment portfolio
* The flexibility is limited by broad parameters of the investment objective of the scheme
* Since these funds require the fund manager's active involvement, the expenses for running the fund are higher
* Investors expect these types of funds to perform better than the market

### Passive Funds
* These funds invest based on a specific index of whose performance it seeks to track
* For example, if a particular fund is tracking Nifty 50, it would buy only those shares that are part of the composition of the Nifty 50
* Each share in the scheme's portfolio will be of the same proportion as that of the weightage assigned to the share in the computation of the Nifty 50
* Hence, the performance of these funds reflects the concerned index
* These are not designed to perform better than the market. Since it is the index itself which decides the portfolio of these funds, they are called Index Schemes.
* The fund manager has no role to play in deciding on investments and hence have these funds have a low running costs.


### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
These funds are passive funds. The portfolio of this fund replicates an equity market index or a commodity index. The units are offered in a New Fund Offer (NFO). Post NFO, they are open for sell and purchase in a stock exchange. The units are credited to investor's demat account. Post NFO transactions are performed to trading and settlement platform of stock exchange. The ETF units are traded at realtime prices which are linked to changes in underlying index.

### Equity-Oriented Funds

Equity schemes are those scheme which have investment objectives to invest largely in equity shares and equity-related investments like convertible debentures. Investment object of such funds is to seek capital appreciation through investment in this growth asset.

Fund manager perform research and identify companies with good future prospects and invest in the shares of such companies. Prices of listed securities fluctuate based on liquidity, international scenario and numerous other factors. Therefore, investment in equity funds carries higher risk. Investors should understand the features of equity investments in terms of risk and return before investing.

#### Definition

##### Index Funds
Index funds are less riskier funds. Index funds invest in stocks comprising of indices, such as Nifty 50. Nifty 50 is a broad based index comprising of 50 stocks. Funds on other indices can have a large number of stocks as the Nifty Midcap 100 or Nifty 500. Here investment is spread across a large number of stocks. Today, we see large of of Index Funds which comprises of **Large**, **Liquid**, **Blue Chip** 50 stocks.

The object of a typical Index Funds states "This stock will invest in stocks comprising of 50 and in the same proportion as in the index.
* The fund manager will not indulge in the stock selection
* Fund manager will invest passively in Nifty 50 scripts only
* Due to this, Index Funds are known as passively managed funds
* Lower costs and returns
* Closely tracks the bench mark index

###### Tracking Error
It is the difference between return generated by Benchmark Index and the Index Fund

```
Tracking Error = (Returns generated by Benchmark Index) - (Returns generated by Index Fund)
```

Fund with least **Tracking Error** are
* most preferred by investors
* Tracks the index closely
* A function of the scheme expenses. It means lower the expenses lesser the **Tracking Error**

##### Equity Scheme
* Equity is ownership in the company which has issued shares to the extent of shares held. Shareholders exercise their voting rights which are associated with the shares they hold, and take part in the management of the company.
* In addition to this, they take part in the residual profits of the company, that is, the profits remaining after all the dues and claims against the company have been met in the form of dividends.
* The shareholders benefit from the profit and revenues of the company in the form of high dividends they may be paid.
* However, equity holders are not given any assurance that dividend will be paid or about the amount that would be paid as dividend.
* If a particular company attains distributable profits, the management decides to use the profits for expansion plans, paying off debt and other financial activities which are expected to increase the value of the shares of the company.
* In such situations the company may not pay any dividends to the shareholders. Apart from dividends, equity investors benefit from the appreciation in the value of the shares.
* Investing in equity is investment in a growth-oriented asset.
* The investor benefits from the appreciation in the value of the investment. When there are adequate profits the company declares the dividends and provides periodic income to the shareholders.

##### Debt Schemes
* The borrowings of the issuer are represented as debt
* As an asset class, debt represents an income-oriented asset
* The major source of return from a debt instrument is regular income in the form of interest which is typically known at the time of issue
* This may be guaranteed either by an undertaking of the government or by security created on the physical assets of the issuer
* The conditions such as the coupon or interest payable on the debt, the tenure of the borrowing after which the borrower/issuer has to return the principal to the lenders/investors, the security against the assets of the borrower offered as collateral, and so on are determined by the terms of issue.

##### Hybrid Scheme
* Hybrid funds have an investment charter which gives scope for investment in both debt and equity.
* Some of them invest in gold along with either debt or equity or both.

##### Solution Oriented Scheme
* Solution-Oriented Schemes are those schemes with an investment objective directed towards a specific goal aimed in future.
* For example, retirement solution or investments for children are called Solution Oriented Schemes.

#### Types of Schemes Based on Market Capitalisation
As you may already be aware, Cap or Market Capitalisation is the total value of a company based on the current market price of share multiplied by the no of share outstanding. Based on Cap companies are classified as.
1. Large Cap Companies: Top 100 or 200 stocks which feature in Nifty 50
1. Mid Cap Companies: Stocks below large cap which belong to mid cap segment
1. Small Cap Companies: Stocks with market capitalisation of less than Rs. 5000 cr

Large cap funds are those that have
1. Sound businesses
1. Strong management
1. Globally competitive products
1. Quick to respond to market dynamics

Diversified large cap funds are considered as stable and safe. These stocks command high liquidity. However, equity funds are
1. Risky asset class
1. No guarantee for any type of fund
1. Actively managed

##### Actively Managed Funds
Except index fund, all other funds are actively managed funds. They have higher expenses as compared to index funds. Fund manager invests in stock beyond the index. Any stocks that involve active decision making may incur higher expenses and hence higher risks. Risk level increases from Index Fund, Large Cap Fund, Mid Cap Fund to Small Cap Fund. The conclusion here are actively managed funds
1. should deliver higher returns than the index
1. investors must be compensated for higher risks
1. studies have shown most actively managed funds are unable to beat the index returns on a consistent basis. There is no gurantee as to which actively managed fund will beat the index in a given year
1. Index funds have grown exponentially in some countries due to the inconsistency of returns

##### Mid Cap Funds
* Invest in stocks belonging to the mid cap segment of the market
* Many of these midcaps are said to be the 'emerging blue chips' or 'tomorrow's large caps'
* There can be actively managed or passively managed mid cap funds. There are indices such as the Nifty MID 100 and Nifty Midcap 50 indices which track the midcap segment of the markets
* There are some passively managed index funds investing in the Nifty MID 100 and Nifty Midcap 50 companies

##### Sectoral Funds
* Funds that invest in stocks from a single sector or related sectors are called Sectoral funds
* Examples of such funds are Banking Funds, IT Funds, Pharma Funds, Infrastructure Funds, etc.
* Regulations do not permit funds to invest over 10% of their Net Asset Value in a single company
* This is to ensure that schemes are diversified enough and investors are not subjected to concentration risk
* This regulation is relaxed for Sectoral funds and Index funds

#### Equity Schemes
Various other types of **Equity Schemes** are
1. Arbitrage Funds
1. Multi cap Funds
1. Quant Funds
1. International Equities Funds
1. Growth Schemes
1. Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS)
1. Fund of Funds

##### Arbitrage Funds
* These funds invest in the cash and the derivatives market simultaneously
* They take advantage of the price differential of a stock in the cash and derivative segment by taking opposite positions in the two markets
* Examples of these types of funds are cash and stock futures

##### Multi cap Funds
* These funds can, theoretically, have a small cap portfolio today and a large cap portfolio tomorrow.
* The fund manager has total freedom to invest in any stock from any sector.

##### Quant Funds
Quantitive models are used for stock selection and allocation of weights. Selection and allocation is based on company's
* Size
* Financial performance
* Liquidity

SID (scheme information document) - specifies the use of a quantitative model
* Stock Price which includes parameters based on periodic moving average of price, market capitalisation

##### International Equities Funds
It invests in stocks of companies outside India. It can be
* Fund of Funds - invests in other mutual funds

##### Growth Schemes
These schemes aim for capital appreciation by investing in growth funds. They focus on industries and specific companies experiencing revenue growth rather than companies that payout dividend. These companies are in growth phase so, requires a holding period of at least 5 to 10 years and thus a higher risk tolerance. Time horizon for return is medium to long term.

###### Example
PU Mutual fund is investing in growth companies. It's **investing objective** is invest in companies/stocks with high growth rates or above average potential. The fund manager will follow an active investment strategy and focus on rapid growth companies or sectors. The selection of stocks will be based on growth measures such as
1. Enterprise value/EBITA
1. Forward price/sales
1. Discounted EPS (Earning Per Share)

The primary focus of these companies is to identify high growth companies especially on sector witnessing above average growth. A combination of Top-Down macro analysis approach to identify sectors and Bottom-Up approach micro analysis to pick stocks within these sectors will be employed. Switch between companies and sectors is identified based on
* Relative Valuations
* Liquidity
* Growth potential

##### Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS)
These schemes invest in equity schemes where investors get tax benefit up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. These are Open-Ended schemes with locking period of 3 years. These schemes are designed for dual purpose of equity investing as well as tax planning for the investor. On these schemes investors cannot get their money back before 3 years from the date of investment under any circumstances.

##### Fund of Funds
These funds do not invest directly in stocks or share. They invest in units of other mutual funds which perform well and give high returns.

#### Growth and Value Investing
##### Growth Investing
* Investing in companies with high growth potential
* Look for companies that are experiencing significant earnings or revenue growth
* Investors look for growth momentum

The risk of growth investing is that if growth momentum goes down slightly stock's price can go down rather fast

##### Value Investing
* A sector/stock is currently undervalued and market will eventually realize it's true value
* Investors buy undervalued stock/sector and wait for value to move up and then exit
* Investors look for mismatch between the current market price and the true value of the investment

The risk of growth investing is that the investor may have to wait a really long time before the market values the investment correctly

#### Contra Funds
Contra fund follow a value investing approach. 

##### Example
When interest rate rise, people defer their purchases as the cost of borrowing increases. This affects bank, housing and auto sector. Stocks of these companies come down. Hence the fund manager will opine that when the interest rates come down these stocks will go up again. Thus, he will buy these stocks when nobody wants them. He will take a contrarian call. 

#### Assets Under Management (AUM)
AUM represents the money which is managed by a mutual fund in a scheme. Sum of AUMs of all schemes represents AUM of a fund house. Sum of AUMs of all fund houses represents industry AUM.

```
AUM = (Net Asset Value (NAV) of a scheme) x (Number of units issued by the scheme)
```

Change in AUM happens due to redemptions of inflows. If sharp market fall happens then NAV will move down. It leads to redemption pressure and AUMs may come down. If outlook is positive, it leads to inflow of funds leading to overall increase in the AUM. If the fund produces superior returns then the benchmark index it results into inflows into the scheme, leading to an increase in AUM.
