### Open-Ended Fund
* Allows investors to enter and exit at his convenience
* Allows investors to buy the units even after the NFO period is over
* The buy/sell of units takes place at the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by fund

**Note:**
* A new fund is launched by AMC, is known as New Fund Offer (NFO)
* Units are offered to investors at the par value of Rs. 10/unit
* When the fund sells units, the investors buy the units from the fund and when the investor wishes to redeem units, the fund repurchases the units from the investor. This can be done even after the NFO has closed

### Close-Ended Fund
* Restricts the freedom of entry and exit
* Allows investors to invest only during NFO period; that is as long as the scheme is open for subscription
* Does not allow new investors to enter or existing investors to exit once the NFO closes and till the term of the scheme comes to an end
* Lists its schemes on stock exchanges in order to provide entry and exit options to investors
* Provides opportunity for investors to buy and sell the units from each other
* Is just like buying/selling shares on the stock exchange and is done through a stock broker

**Note:**
The outstanding units of the fund does not increase/decrease since the fund itself is not selling any units.

Sometimes, close ended funds also offer 'buy-back of fund shares/units', thus offering another avenue for investors to exit the fund.

Therefore, regulations drafted in India permit investors in close ended funds to exit even before the term is over.

* Investors expect these types of funds to perform better than the market

### Passive Funds

* For example, if a particular fund is tracking Nifty 50, it would buy only those shares that are part of the composition of the Nifty 50
* Each share in the scheme's portfolio will be of the same proportion as that of the weightage assigned to the share in the computation of the Nifty 50
* Hence, the performance of these funds reflects the concerned index
