## Types of Funds
Based on entry and exit criteria of investors, funds are of two types.
* Open-Ended Fund
* Close-Ended Fund

### Open-Ended Fund
* Allows investors to enter and exit at his convenience
* Allows investors to buy the units even after the NFO period is over
* The buy/sell of units takes place at the Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by fund

**Note:**
* A new fund is launched by AMC, is known as New Fund Offer (NFO)
* Units are offered to investors at the par value of Rs. 10/unit
* When the fund sells units, the investors buy the units from the fund and when the investor wishes to redeem units, the fund repurchases the units from the investor. This can be done even after the NFO has closed

### Close-Ended Fund
* Restricts the freedom of entry and exit
* Allows investors to invest only during NFO period; that is as long as the scheme is open for subscription
* Does not allow new investors to enter or existing investors to exit once the NFO closes and till the term of the scheme comes to an end
* Lists its schemes on stock exchanges in order to provide entry and exit options to investors
* Provides opportunity for investors to buy and sell the units from each other
* Is just like buying/selling shares on the stock exchange and is done through a stock broker

**Note:**
The outstanding units of the fund does not increase/decrease since the fund itself is not selling any units.

Sometimes, close ended funds also offer 'buy-back of fund shares/units', thus offering another avenue for investors to exit the fund.

Therefore, regulations drafted in India permit investors in close ended funds to exit even before the term is over.


Based on type of involvement of fund manager, funds are of two types.
* Actively Managed Funds
* Passive Funds

### Actively Managed Funds
* These are funds wherein the fund manager is:
    * Actively involved and has a greater role to play
    * Free to choose the investment portfolio
* The flexibility is limited by broad parameters of the investment objective of the scheme
* Since these funds require the fund manager's active involvement, the expenses for running the fund are higher
* Investors expect these types of funds to perform better than the market

### Passive Funds
* These funds invest based on a specific index of whose performance it seeks to track
* For example, if a particular fund is tracking Nifty 50, it would buy only those shares that are part of the composition of the Nifty 50
* Each share in the scheme's portfolio will be of the same proportion as that of the weightage assigned to the share in the computation of the Nifty 50
* Hence, the performance of these funds reflects the concerned index
* These are not designed to perform better than the market. Since it is the index itself which decides the portfolio of these funds, they are called Index Schemes.
* The fund manager has no role to play in deciding on investments and hence have these funds have a low running costs.


### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
These funds are passive funds. The portfolio of this fund replicates an equity market index or a commodity index. The units are offered in a New Fund Offer (NFO). Post NFO, they are open for sell and purchase in a stock exchange. The units are credited to investor's demat account. Post NFO transactions are performed to trading and settlement platform of stock exchange. The ETF units are traded at realtime prices which are linked to changes in underlying index.
