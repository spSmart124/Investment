# Account Valuation and Taxation of Mutual Fund Schemes
## Calculation of NAV
We have already understood the meaning for NAV (Net Asset Value). Now, we can better understand calculation of it through an example.

### Example
Let's say investors have bought 40 crore units of a mutual fund at Rs. 10. Thus we can say that the mutual fund has mobilised Rs. 400 crore investment. At the same time an amount of Rs. 280 crore invested in equity got appreciated by 10%. An amount of Rs. 100 mobilised from investors was deposited in a bank.

Interest and dividend received through the scheme is Rs. 16 crore. The scheme experienced an expense of Rs. 8 crore and an additional expense of Rs. 8 crore is also paid.

| Particulars | Amount (Rs. crore) |
| ----------- | ------ |
| **Liabilities**  |       |
| Unit Capital (40 crore units of Rs 10 each) | 400 |
| Profits {Rs 16 crore (interest and dividend received) minus Rs 8 crore (expenses paid) minus Rs 2 crore (expenses payable)} | 6 |
| Capital Appreciation on Investments held (10 percent of Rs 280 crore) | 28 |
| Unit-holders' Funds in the Scheme | 434 |
| Expenses payable | 2 |
| Scheme Liabilities | 436 |
| **Assets** | |
| Market value of Investments (Rs 280 crore + 10 percent) | 308 |
| Bank Deposits {Rs 120 crore (original) plus Rs 16 crore (interest and dividend received) minus Rs 8 crore (expenses paid)} | 128 |
| Scheme Assets | 436 |


```
Net Asset = Amount Invested + Profit + Appreciation incurred in the investment
```

Net asset will rise whether or not profit realized due to increase in market price of securities. A scheme cannot show better profit by delaying the payments. While calculating profit all the expense related to a period needs to be considered whether or not paid. In accounting this is called as **Accrual Principle**. Similarly, any income that relates to a period will boost profit irrespective of it has been deposited in the bank account or not.

For this example
```
NAV (Value of each unit of scheme) = Unit-holder's Funds in the scheme (Net Assets) / No of outstanding units
```

So it can be calculated as
```
434 / 10 = 10.85
```

Another way of calculating NAV is
```
NAV = (Total Assets - Liabilities other than to unit holders) / No of outstanding units
```

In this example it is
```
(436 - 2) / 40 = 10.85
```

This gives us profitability matrics

### Numeric Example 1
Information provided:
* Value of stocks: Rs. 300 crore
* Value of bonds: Rs. 134 сrоге
* Value of money market instruments: Rs. 4.72 crore
* Dividend accrued but not received: Rs. 2.18 croге
* Interest accrued but not received: Rs. 5.36 crore
* Fees payable: Rs. 0.72 crore
* No. of outstanding units: 3.80 croгe

```
NAV = (Value of stocks + Value of bonds + Value of money market instruments + Dividend accrued but not received + Interest accrued but not received - Fees payable) / No. of outstanding units
```

```
NAV = (300 + 134 + 4.72 +2.18 + 5.36-0.72) / 3.80 = 445.54/3.80 = Rs. 117.24
```

### Numeric Example 2
* Value of stocks: Rs. 460 crore
* Value of money market instruments: Rs. 10 crore
* Dividend accrued but not received: Rs. 4.78 crore
* Amount payable on purchase of shares: Rs. 15.0 crore
* Amount receivable on sale of shares: Rs. 4.68 croгe
* Fees payable: Rs. 0.82 crore
* No. of outstanding units: 5.30 crore

```
NAV = (460 + 10 + 4.78 +4.68-15.0-0.82) / 5.30 = 463.64/5.30 = Rs. 87.47
```

### Mark to Market
**Mark to market** is the process of valuing each security in the investment portfolio of the scheme as per its current market value.

NAV reflects the true worth of each unit of the scheme, because investors buy or sell units on the basis of the information in NAV.

In case investments are not marked to market, then the value of investment portfolio will be the same on which security was purchased.

#### Example
Valuing a company at it's aquisition cost of Rs. 30 has no meaning if the price has appreciated to Rs. 100. In case there is a scheme to sell the share then at that time then it would recover Rs. 100 not Rs. 30. So, when NAV captures the movement of shares from Rs. 30 to Rs. 100 then it is meaningful for the investors. 

* Marking to market helps investors buy and sell units of a scheme at fair prices, which are determined based on transparently calculated and freely shared information on NAV
* This mark-to- market based NAV helps in evaluating the performance of the scheme/fund manager.
