# Liquid Funds
## Definition
Liquid mutual funds are schemes that make investments in debt and money market securities with maturity of up to 91 days only.

Debt Markets are divided into two segments.
* Money Market: Term to maturity is overnight or less than 1 year
* Capital Market: Term to maturity is 1 to 20 years



## Money Markets
Debt Markets Instruments having debt like characteristics (interest, term to maturity) are traded in **Money Market**.

Money market instruments are
* Commercial Papers
* Certificate of Deposits
* Treasury Bills
* Collateralized Borrowing ending Obligations (CBLOS)
* Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)

## Salient Features
Liquid funds carry an important position as an investment option for individuals and corporates to park their short term liquidity.

Corporates can get a better return than a bank account on a relatively acceptable level of risk.

## Cut Off Time
Cut-off timings observed by a mutual fund while purchasing units in liquid fund schemes are:

| Time of application receipt | Availability of funds without credit facility | Closing NAV applicable |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Upto 2 pm | Available | Of previous day |
| After 2 pm | Available | Of present day |
| Anytime | Not Available | Of one day prior to day on which funds are made available |

## Valuation of Liquid Funds
Valuation of securities is very important for liquid funds as the term is very short. The maturity and benchmark rates are important consideration for such valuation.

### Maturity Upto 60 days
All Money Market and Debt Securities including Floating rate Securities with residual maturity of upto 60 days
* Shall be valued at the weighted average price at which they are traded on the particular valuation day.
* If not traded, valued on amortization basis.

### Maturity Over 60 days
All Money Market and Debt Securities including Floating rate Securities with residual maturity of upto 60 days
* Shall be valued at weighted average price at which they are traded on the particular valuation day.
* If not traded, valued at benchmark yield/matrix of spread over risk free benchmark yield obtained from agencies identified by AMFI.

### Benchmark Rates
* A risk free benchmark yield using Govt Securities as base.
* A matrix of spreads based on credit risk

### Example
Suppose a 90 days Corporate Paper is issued at Rs. 91. Paper will redeem at Rs. 100 on maturity. This means the investor will earn
```
100 - 91 = 9
```

Earning after 90 days = Rs. 9

This translate into daily earning of
```
Each day earning = 90 / 9 = 0.10
```

It means the investor will earn 10 paise every day assuming there is no coupon. Please note that although we calculated earning of 10 paise/day there is no cash flow coming to the investor. It means the interest is only getting accrued. If the investor wishes to sell this after 35 days in the secondary market what should be the price he should sell.

Here the total accrued interest is added to the cost of buying the Corporate Paper (CP) to calculate the current book value. This method is known as Cost Plus Interest Accrued method.

```
35 * 0.10 = Rs. 3.5
```

Rs. 3.5 have got accrued. So, the current book value is.

```
91 + 3.5 = 94.5
```
