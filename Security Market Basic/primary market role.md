## Primary Market
The primary market provides the channel for sale of new securities. It provides the opportunity to issuers of securities, both government and corporate company, to raise resources to meet their requirements.

### Shares
Shares are an indivisible unit of a company's capital. Primary market issues the securities at face value, or at a discount/premium.

### Face Value
It is the nominal or stated amount in ruppees assigned to a security by the issuer. It is the original cost of stock shown on the certificate for shares. For bonds, it is the amount paid to the holder at maturity.

Equity shares face value is usually a small number like Rs.5/ or Rs.10/. It does not have much barring on price of share which may quote higher in the market like Rs.100/ or Rs.1000 or any other price that the market decides.

The face value of debt security for government and corporate is usually Rs.100. The price at which it is traded will depend on the fluctuation of interest rate.

## Discount and Premium
Securities are generally issued in denominations of Rs.5/, Rs.10/ or Rs.100/. This is known as the
Face Value or Par Value of the security. When a security is sold above its face value, it is said
to be issued at a Premium and if it is sold at less than its face value, then it is said to be issued at a Discount. Normally, issues are made at premium. Discount issues are rarely made.

## IPO
Most companies are started privately by their promoter or promoters. However, the promoter's capital and the borrowing from banks and financial institutions may not be sufficient for setting up or running the business in long term especially when the business grows and looks to expand.

**Key points**:
Companies invite the public to contribute towards the equity and issue shares to individual investors.

The way to invite share capital from public is through a public issue. Simply put, a public issue is a offer to the public to subscribe to the share capital of a company. Once this is done the company allots share to the applicant as per the prescribed rules and regulations laid down by SEBI.

Public and rights issue involve detailed procedure. Whereas procedure of preferential or private placements are relatively simpler.

#### Public
Public issues can be of two types.
* Initial Public Offering (IPO)
* Follow-on Offering

##### Initial Public Offering (IPO)
Initial Public Offering (IPO) is offered by an unlisted company, for the first time, in the form of
1. fresh issue of securities
1. offer for sale of existing securities

This paves the way for listing and trading of the Issuer's securities.

##### Follow-on Offering (FPO)
Follow-on Offering (FPO) is offered by an already listed company as:
* fresh sale
* offer for sale

**Fresh Sale** is also known as **Dilutive** as this increases the no of share in the market. **OFS** on the other hand is also known as "Non Dilutive** as the existing big share holders like director offer their share for sale to the public.

#### Rights
Rights issue is offered by a listed company as proposal of issuing fresh securities to its existing shareholders as on a record date. The rights are normally offered on a particula ratio to the no of securities held prior to the issue. For example a rights issue in the ratio 1:1 will double the no of share held by existing share holders. This route is best suited for companies try to raise capital without diluting the stake of existing share holders.

#### Preferential
It is an issue of shared or of convertible securities by listed companies to a select group of persons under 62 of Companies Act 2013. This is a faster way to raise equity capital. The issuer company has to comply with the Company Act and the requirements in chapter pertaining to prefential allotment under SEBI guidelines which inter alia include disclosure, pricing, notice etc.


Going for primary market issue, a company has to decide the issue price and calculate it's market capitalisation.

### Issue Price
**Issue Price** is the price at which a company's shares are offered initially in the Primary market. During the trade of the issues, the market price may be above or below the issue price. Investors can follow trades of public issues on the NSE website to check for market price.

### Market Capitalisation
Market Capitalisation = Current Share Price * No of Shares in the Market
