## Primary Market
The primary market provides the channel for sale of new securities. It provides the opportunity to issuers of securities, both government and corporate company, to raise resources to meet their requirements.

### Shares
Shares are an indivisible unit of a company's capital. Primary market issues the securities at face value, or at a discount/premium.

### Face Value
It is the nominal or stated amount in ruppees assigned to a security by the issuer. It is the original cost of stock shown on the certificate for shares. For bonds, it is the amount paid to the holder at maturity.

Equity shares face value is usually a small number like Rs.5/ or Rs.10/. It does not have much barring on price of share which may quote higher in the market like Rs.100/ or Rs.1000 or any other price that the market decides.

The face value of debt security for government and corporate is usually Rs.100. The price at which it is traded will depend on the fluctuation of interest rate.

## Discount and Premium
Securities are generally issued in denominations of Rs.5/, Rs.10/ or Rs.100/. This is known as the
Face Value or Par Value of the security. When a security is sold above its face value, it is said
to be issued at a Premium and if it is sold at less than its face value, then it is said to be issued at a Discount. Normally, issues are made at premium. Discount issues are rarely made.

## IPO
Most companies are started privately by their promoter or promoters. However, the promoter's capital and the borrowing from banks and financial institutions may not be sufficient for setting up or running the business in long term especially when the business grows and looks to expand.

**Key points**:
Companies invite the public to contribute towards the equity and issue shares to individual investors.

The way to invite share capital from public is through a public issue. Simply put, a public issue is a offer to the public to subscribe to the share capital of a company. Once this is done the company allots share to the applicant as per the prescribed rules and regulations laid down by SEBI.
